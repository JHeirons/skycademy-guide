# 2. Build a Team

Once you are back in your school or organisaion, you'll need to assemble a motley crew of people who will help you in your epic quest to rule the skies. Here's our concise guide to team building:

**1. Colleagues** The best place to start is feeding back to your colleagues and finding out who else might be interested in helping out for your launches. You are going to need people who can:
  - advise and help others with a general level of knowledge about how a launch works
  - drive groups of people to different sites while launching, tracking and retrieving your flights
  - potentially provide first aid in the event of injury
  
TO DO:
Invite your colleagues to a show and tell session on what you learned from Skycademy. You can use the presentation we shared with you as a starting point.

**2. Students** Your students are ultimately going to be the ones who benefit the most from participating in the flight. For larger cohorts, it becomes essential to assign groups of people to different roles. Typical roles are:
  - Payload Makers - concentrates on assembling and testing the payload equipment
  - Tracker Makers - concentrates on assembling and testing the tracking equipment
  - Launch Makers  - focuses on carrying out all the pre-flight checks, measurements and assembly of the balloon's train on launch day

TO DO:
Make a rough list of which students you would like to allocate to each of these teams.

**3. Transport** You will need to find a safe way of transporting people to and from your launches. Some schools/organisations have their own minibus to use, but you may want to invest in a coach or several helpers to ferry people around. 

TO DO:
Make a note of what transport is needed for your launch group.

**4. Trackers**

![what happens in a balloon flight?](1/whathappens.JPG)

- A flight involves sending a lightweight payload into the upper atmosphere (not space) attached to a weather balloon
- The balloon, filled with either Hydrogen or Helium generates the lift required to reach the upper atmosphere
- At the apex of the flight the balloon, stretched due to decreased air pressure, will burst leaving the payload to fall back down to earth
- During the descent the payload is slowed by a parachute which is between the payload and the balloon
- You goal is to successfully launch the balloon and be at (or near) the landing site when the balloon comes down
- The chart shows a fairly typical flight profile, rising steadily to a height of 38km and then descending fairly rapidly

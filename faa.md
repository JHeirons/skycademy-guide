If you are planning to launch a balloon flight in the US it is your responsibility to ensure you are compliant with federal [regulations](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/ECFR?page=browse).

The key points are outlined below:

### Subpart A
This part outlines the types of balloons that can be flown without a formal application to the FAA.

  - (i) Carries a payload package that weighs more than four pounds and has a weight/size ratio of more than three ounces per square inch on any surface of the package, determined by dividing the total weight in ounces of the payload package by the area in square inches of its smallest surface;
  - (ii) Carries a payload package that weighs more than six pounds;
  - (iii) Carries a payload, of two or more packages, that weighs more than 12 pounds; or
  - (iv) Uses a rope or other device for suspension of the payload that requires an impact force of more than 50 pounds to separate the suspended payload from the balloon.

Any "exceptional" payloads which don't conform to the criteria outlined in section 101.1 must met the all restrictions set out in subpart D:
- [101.31](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=&SID=9accbf4b408fe5b88e1914164a097dd8&mc=true&r=PART&n=pt14.2.101#se14.2.101_131) explains when these restrictions are applicable.

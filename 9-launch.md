# 9. Launch, Chase and Recover

Here's our walkthrough for anyone wishing to prepare for their launch. More detailed guides for certain procedures can be found in our other guides and are linked to within the text.

ONE MONTH BEFORE

1. Order Balloon(s)
2. Get Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) permission to launch, including NOTAM - "a notice filed with an aviation authority to alert aircraft pilots of potential hazards along a flight route or at a location that could affect the safety of the flight."
3. Confirm transport arrangements. 
4. Confirm extra staffing needs. 
5. Complete offsite risk assessment.

ONE WEEK BEFORE

1. Order Helium.
2. Complete your pre-flight calculations and measure out how much water you will need to achieve the right ascent rate for the balloon? (jump to Section 7 - Calculate Your Flight Profile for a detailed description of how to achieve this.)
2. Make sure students and adult supervisors are clear on their different roles at the launch.


THE DAY BEFORE

1. Check the predicted flight path at your launch time using the [CUSF Landing Predictor](http://predict.habhub.org/).
2. Charge all things that rely on battery power during launch day.
3. Check all your components against your launch inventory list to ensure everything you need is packed for transport.

ON THE DAY TAKE

1. CAA Permit
2. Telephone Numbers: ATC - local airfields, emergency services
3. Payload, batteries (+ spares) RADAR reflector, parachute, cutdown (+ spares)
4. Balloons, Cable ties, Cord, Duct Tape
5. Helium, regulator, filling system
6. Tools inc. Spanners set up filling system
7. Scales, weights.
8. Radio System: Receiver, Yagi, Stand, PC, Software, Audio-lead, Batteries (+ spares)
9. Ancillary stuff like: Table, Chairs, Sun/Rain shade
10. Recovery: GPS, long telescopic pole (for trees), string, PMR (intra recovery team comms)
11. Boots/Wet Weather clothes/Sun Hat/Suncream/Water/Food

ON ARRIVAL AT THE LAUNCH SITE

1. Check the predicted flight path at your launch time. Weather in the UK is so varied, it's always best to check on the day!
2. Contact the Civil Aviation Authority again to confirm your launch window.
3. Lay out tarpaulin and secure with tent pegs.
4. Power up your payload and check it's posting images to HABHUB.
5. Power up your tracking equipment and check that you are receiving a clear signal from the payload.
6. Secure your payload in it's polystyrene capsule with lots of gaffa tape. Make sure the camera module is also securely fastened in position.
7. Attach lengths of nylon cord to your payload and attach the parachute.
8. Put on your latex gloves. Lay your balloon out carefully on the tarpaulin and inspect for wear and tear.
9. Use cable ties to fasten the neck and mouth of the balloon round the balloon-to-gas cylinder adapter. Attach the weighed out water in a bottle to the balloon using nylon cord.
10. Turn on the gas to begin filling the balloon. Continue to fill until the balloon gently rises with the water bottle attached.
11. Carefully cut the cable ties holding the balloon neck on to the adapter with your snips and slide the adapter out while gripping the neck tightly to not let gas out. 
12. Cable tie the neck twice above where you are holding it. 
13. Fold the excess neck up and wrap with gaffa tape. Make sure someone sensible is now holding the balloon or it will fly away!
14. Remove the water bottle and attach the payload to the balloon using gaffa tape.
15. Do a quick test for wind direction by throwing some grass in the air. Check that the balloon isn't going to fly in to a hazard such as trees, pylons, etc.
16. Do a final check to make sure you are still getting a signal.
17. Let go of the balloon to launch!

TRACKING THE FLIGHT

The time the balloon takes to launch, ascend to maximum height, burst, descend slowly via parachute, and land is about 2.5 hours. You therefore have plenty of time to track the payload in the following ways:

TRACKER BOX - **link to article on making the tracker box** will continue to decode flight data and give you read outs for current altitude.

LAPTOP WITH A DATA ROAMING WIFI DONGLE - having roaming internet connectivity will enable you to log on to HABHUB and track your flight on a map overlay with a predicted landing point. The live predictions can change quite considerably during a flight, so you should only start to pay attention once the balloon has burst and is descending.

ANDROID PHONE - **[not sure what to put here James]**

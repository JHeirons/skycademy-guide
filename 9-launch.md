# 9. Launch, Chase and Recover

ONE WEEK BEFORE

1. Check all your components against your launch inventory list to ensure everything you need is packed for transport.
2. Have you done your pre-flight calculations and measured out how much water you will need to achieve the right ascent rate for the balloon? (jump to Section 7 - Calculate Your Flight Profile for a detailed description of how to achieve this.)
2. Transport arrangements been confirmed?
3. Extra staffing needs been confirmed?
4. Are both students and adult supervisors clear on their different roles at the launch?
5. Offsite risk assessments been completed?
6. Have you contacted the Civil Aviation Authority to inform them of your intention to launch?
7. Check the predicted flight path at your launch time using the [CUSF Landing Predictor](http://predict.habhub.org/).

ON ARRIVAL AT THE LAUNCH SITE

1. Check the predicted flight path at your launch time. Weather in the UK is so varied, it's always best to check on the day!
2. Contact the Civil Aviation Authority again to confirm your launch window.
3. Lay out tarpaulin and secure with tent pegs.
4. Power up your payload and check it's posting images to HABHUB.
5. Power up your tracking equipment and check that you are receiving a clear signal from the payload.
6. Secure your payload in it's polystyrene capsule with lots of gaffa tape. Make sure the camera module is also securely fastened in position.
7. Attach lengths of nylon cord to your payload and attach the parachute.
8. Put on your latex gloves. Lay your balloon out carefully on the tarpaulin and inspect for wear and tear.
9. Use cable ties to fasten the neck and mouth of the balloon round the balloon-to-gas cylinder adapter. Attach the weighed out water in a bottle to the balloon using nylon cord.
10. Turn on the gas to begin filling the balloon. Continue to fill until the balloon gently rises with the water bottle attached.
11. Carefully cut the cable ties holding the balloon neck on to the adapter, slide the adapter out while gripping the neck tightly to not let gas out. 
12. Cable tie the neck twice near where you are holding it. 
13. Fold the excess neck up and wrap with gaffa tape. Make sure someone sensible is now holding the balloon or it will fly away!
14. Remove the water bottle and attach the payload to the balloon using gaffa tape.
15. Do a quick test for wind direction by throwing some grass in the air. Check that the released balloon isn't immediately going to fly in to a hazard such as trees, pylons, etc.
16. Do a final check to make sure you are still getting a signal.
17. Let go of the balloon to launch!

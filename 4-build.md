## Assembly

This guide shows you how to assemble a RTTY and LoRA board stack using the [Pi In The Sky kit](https://store.uputronics.com/index.php?route=product/product&path=62&product_id=52). You'll need a crosshead screwdriver for assembly.

When your kit arrives, check you have the components pictured below:

**Fig. 3.** Unclip the head of the Picamera and Plug in the other end to the A+ board's camera port. We are unclipping the head so the Picamera ribbon can be threaded through the stacked boards. We can re-attach the head later. The ribbon's blue tab should be facing the USB ports.

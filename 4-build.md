## Assembly

This guide shows you how to assemble a RTTY and LoRa board stack using the [Pi In The Sky kit](https://store.uputronics.com/index.php?route=product/product&path=62&product_id=52). You'll need a crosshead screwdriver for assembly.

When your kit arrives, check you have the components pictured below. You will also get a GPS antenna and battery pack in your kit (not pictured).

**Fig. 1.** Start by screwing 2 stand offs in to the A+ board.

**Fig. 2.** Push the 10mm GPIO pin extender on to the A+ board's pins.

**Fig. 3.** Unclip the head of the Picamera and clip the other end in to the A+ board's camera port. We unclip the head so the Picamera ribbon can be threaded through the stacked boards. We can re-attach the head later. The ribbon's blue tab should be facing the USB port.

**Fig. 4.** Slide the Pi In The Sky board gently down on to the pin extender.

**Fig. 5.** Pull the Picamera ribbon through the slot, screw the Male to Female standoffs in the original standoffs and slide the remaining pin extender on the exposed pins.

**Fig. 6.** Push the LoRa board gently on to the pin extender and screw it on to the two standoffs. The stack should now be completely flush.

# 3. Research a launch site

For your HAB launch to be successful you need to locate a suitable launch site (or two) to use on the day of the launch.

An ideal site would have a large open space where the balloon can be safely filled, have easy access from the road so you can transport all the quipment, and provide some shelter from the wind. Additionally you want to ensure your're not going to ba launching too close to a tree line or buildings that might snag your payload as it ascends into the air.

Another key point to consider is who owns the land and who do you have to ask permission from before lauchning. Some sites might also require you to have public liability insurance, if you're taking students along to the lauch for instance.

## Run a prediction with sample data

Once you've found a possible site, you're going to need to make a prediction as to your balloon's flight path and probable landing site. There are several variables that can affect your balloon's flight path, such as it's mass, it's ascent rate and it's burst altitude. Of course the variable with the biggest impact is the wind. Luckily there is a tool available on [Habhub](http://predict.habhub.org) for predicting the probable flight path of a balloon.

1. In a browser navigate to [the Habhub predictor](http://predict.habhub.org)
1. You'll be presented with a map that should be centered around you current location.
1. The first thing to do is to find the logitude and latitude of your launch site. Find your launch site on the map by zooming in, and then with your cursor hovering over the launch site, note down the longitude and latitude displayed in the top right corner of the screen.

1. Now you can enter those coordinates into the *Prediction* box at bottom right of the screen, and save the location.
1. If you launch site is considerably above sea level, then it's probably best to add in your altitude. This information is easily obtained from [Free Map Tools](https://www.freemaptools.com/elevation-finder.htm)
1. To begin with, you can set a few default values for your launch:

	|Data|Value|
	|----|-----|
	|Launch Time|`9:00`|
	|Launch Data|`Tomorrow's Date`|
	|Ascent Rate|`5`|
	|Descent Rate|`5`|

1. Click on the `Use Burst Calculator` to find your burst altitude, with the following defaults.

	|Data|Value|
	|----|-----|
	|Payload Mass|`400g`|
	|Balloon Mass|`Hwoyee-500`|
	|Target Scent Rate|`5`|

1. Then click on *Use Values* to accept the Burst Altitude calculation

1. With all the data now entered you can click on Run Prediction to see where your balloon will go.

## Identify challenges

The conditions at 9:00am tomorrow might not be quite the same as your actual launch window. The next task is perfect for your team of students to have a go at.
They can tweek various settings in the Habhub predictor to see where the balloon would travel with slightly heavier or lighter payloads, with slightly different ascent and descent rates, and most importantly when lauched at different times (within a 180 hour window).

What your students need to be wary of is the ballon passing over, or landing in, any of the following environments.

### Airfields / Airports

Unsurprisingly air traffic controllers don't take kindly to high altitude balloons landing in the middle of runways or intefering with aircraft that are trying to take off.

As part of your launch you will be contactng the Civil Aviation Authority (in the UK), and providing and estimated flight plan, so that nearby airfields can be contacted if there is any danger that your flight poses a risk to air traffic. However, it is a good idea to make sure that your flight path is unlikely to intersect with any small airfileds and it is essential that it does not pass near any large Airports.

### Bodies of water

If you're proposed launch site is near the coast, then the most obvious large body of water to avoid is the sea. It's very easy for a high altitude balloon to drift a little further than you had planned due to the unpredicatbility of wind currents and inaccuracies in factors such as burst altitude. If it looks like your payload is likely to land within a few miles of the coast, it is better to be safe than sorry and pick an alternative launch site or time of day.

Small ponds, lakes and rivers are harder to take into account, but if your flight path is such that your payload is likely to come down near a large lake or loch, then it might be best to choose a different launch site.

### Large towns / built up areas

Although the payload is rather small, and unlikely to do any damage to people or objects should it land on them, it is unwise to allow your payload to land in a built up area. A payload coming down on a busy road, could be a danger to traffic for instance. Additionally trying to retrieve your payload when it is lodged on the roof of an apartment building or buried in somebody's back garden may not be easy.

### Border crossings

If you plan to lauch close to a national border, then you need to make sure of a couple of things. Firstly, if your balloon could drift into another terriotry, you have to consider all the laws and permissions you might require to fly in that airspace. Secondly, you had better be sure that you have all the neccessary documents and permissions to travel, needed to retrieve your payload from another country.

### Military bases and Government installations.

GCHQ and the MOD don't take kindly to balloons landing in their bases and installations. Try to make sure that your balloon flight avoids military and governemnt installations that may cause issues when it comes to retrieval. Local knowledge is paramount here. If you know an area is surrounded by barbedwire and patroled by armed guards, it's probably best avoided by your HAB flight.

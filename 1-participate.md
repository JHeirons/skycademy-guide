# 1. Participate in a High Altitude Balloon Launch

A great way to find out what’s involved in a High Altitude Balloon flight is to take part. While no part of a flight is hugely complicated, there are many aspects to manage at once. Taking part can help make these aspects clearer without having to plan and run your own launch.

###Following flights online

There are frequent launches taking place all over the world and many of them track their progress through the tracking website [tracker.habhub.org](tracker.habhub.org) (shown below). Their tools allow you to look for upcoming launches and follow active flights.

###Viewing transmitted images

Many payloads also collect and transmit images back down to earth during their flight. The pictures are received and uploaded to a separate site, [ssdv.habhub.org](ssdv.habhub.org). They appear in the order they are received, newest first, and are tagged using the payload’s name.

###Exploring Flight Data

During a flight, a balloon’s payload also tracks its position and time, plus a whole load of sensor data that you can download and manipulate into visual forms such as graphs, map plots or even flight path animations. To access this data you can visit [http://habitat.habhub.org/ept/](http://habitat.habhub.org/ept/). Enter the name of the flight and payload you want data for, choose the data you want to download, and select CSV, JSON or KML

# 1. Participate in a High Altitude Balloon Launch

A great way to find out whatâ€™s involved in a High Altitude Balloon flight is to take part. While no part of a flight is hugely complicated, there are many aspects to manage at once. Taking part can help make these aspects clearer without having to plan and run your own launch.

###Following flights online

There are frequent launches taking place all over the world and many of them track their progress through the tracking website [tracker.habhub.org](tracker.habhub.org) (shown below). Their tools allow you to look for upcoming launches and follow active flights.
